## 1. JVM and System Level Optimizations

- **Set Appropriate JVM Options:**  
  Tune heap size (`-Xms`, `-Xmx`), garbage collection (`-XX:+UseG1GC`), and thread settings.
- **Use Latest Stable JDK:**  
  Newer versions have performance and security improvements.
- **Monitor Resource Usage:**  
  Use tools like `jvisualvm`, `jconsole`, or Prometheus.

## 2. Dependency Management

- **Remove Unused Dependencies:**  
  Keep `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` clean.
- **Use Spring Boot Starters Wisely:**  
  Only include starters you really need.
- **Upgrade Libraries:**  
  Use up-to-date versions to avoid slow or buggy libraries.

## 3. Application Configuration

- **Enable Spring Profiles:**  
  Separate configurations for dev, test, and prod.
- **Limit Component Scanning:**  
  Avoid broad `@ComponentScan` (narrow it down to required packages).
- **Use `@ConfigurationProperties`**  
  For type-safe configuration and reduced startup time.

## 4. Database Access & JPA

- **Optimize Queries:**  
  Use indexes, avoid N+1 selects, fetch only what you need.
- **Use Connection Pooling:**  
  HikariCP (default in Spring Boot) is fast and efficient.
- **Transaction Management:**  
  Keep transactions short and only as broad as necessary.
- **Batch Operations:**  
  Use batch inserts/updates for large data sets.

## 5. Caching Strategies

- **Use Spring Cache Abstraction:**  
  Integrate with Redis, Ehcache, Caffeine, etc.
- **Cache Expiry Policies:**  
  Tune TTL (time-to-live) for different cache regions.
- **Cache Expensive Computations:**  
  Cache results of methods that are slow or called frequently.

## 6. Asynchronous Processing

- **Enable Async Execution:**  
  Use `@Async` for non-blocking methods.
- **Tune Thread Pools:**  
  Configure executor pool sizes to match workload.

## 7. Spring Bean Scope & Lifecycle

- **Default to Singleton:**  
  Use `@Scope("singleton")` unless you need a different scope.
- **Avoid Prototype Scope:**  
  Unless absolutely necessary, as it can lead to memory leaks.
- **Lazy Initialization:**  
  Use `@Lazy` for beans that are expensive to create and not always needed.

## 8. REST API Performance

- **Use DTOs Instead of Entities:**  
  Minimize data transferred over the network.
- **GZIP Compression:**  
  Enable response compression to save bandwidth.
- **HTTP Connection Pooling:**  
  Tune `RestTemplate` or `WebClient` settings for outbound requests.
- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Protect endpoints from abuse.

## 9. Monitoring & Profiling

- **Integrate Actuator:**  
  `/actuator/metrics`, `/actuator/health` for runtime insights.
- **Use Distributed Tracing:**  
  With Spring Cloud Sleuth, Zipkin, or Jaeger.
- **Profile Application:**  
  Identify bottlenecks using profilers like YourKit, JProfiler, or Java Flight Recorder.

## 10. Common Pitfalls

- Avoid loading large files or data sets into memory.
- Do not overuse `@Transactional` on large methods.
- Beware of circular dependencies between beans.
- Avoid unnecessary autowiringâ€”prefer constructor injection for required dependencies.
